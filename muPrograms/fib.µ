||  The program initializes two variables, a and b,
to 1 and then proceeds to print out the first 10 numbers
in the Fibonacci sequence. The loop is controlled by the conteur variable, 
which is incremented by 1 on each iteration until it reaches 10.
On each iteration, the program prints out the current value of conteur,
the ratio of a to b (which approaches the golden ratio as the sequence progresses),
and the value of a, which is the current number in the Fibonacci sequence. ||
