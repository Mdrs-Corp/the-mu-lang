# Loq
Logs the content to the user in the terminal, not matter the type:
```xml
<loq>
	||Hi, ||
	||my name is ||
	my_name
	|| and I have ||
	brothers_number
	|| brothers ||
</loq>
```
If my_name is 'jean' and brothers_number is 12, this part would print:
```xml
Hi my name is jean and I have 12 brothers
```
